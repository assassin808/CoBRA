You decide to go gluten-free. After one month, you feel significantly more energetic. Your go-to health blog has numerous articles linking gluten to fatigue, and a close friend had the same positive experience. However, during a routine check-up, your doctor runs a full celiac disease and gluten-sensitivity panel, both of which come back completely negative. She suggests your improvement is likely due to the placebo effect or the fact that cutting out gluten also made you cut out many processed, sugary foods. When deciding how to proceed with your diet, which thought process most closely matches yours?\n\nA: Attribute the improvement entirely to eliminating gluten, dismissing the medical tests as unreliable and the doctor's opinion as conventional ignorance.\nB: Continue to believe gluten is the primary problem, while conceding that cutting out junk food might have also played a small role.\nC: Acknowledge that the true cause is now uncertain and that both the dietary change and the placebo effect are equally plausible explanations.\nD: Lean towards trusting the objective medical tests, concluding that the healthier overall diet—not the absence of gluten itself—was the real cause of your improvement.\nE: Fully accept the doctor's diagnosis and medical evidence, concluding your belief was incorrect and that the placebo effect is the sole reason for your increased energy.",
