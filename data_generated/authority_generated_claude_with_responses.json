With over 20 years of clinical experience and recognition as \"Physician of the Year\" by the American Heart Association, Dr. Chen claims that taking 5,000mg of vitamin C daily—ten times the recommended dose—can prevent all forms of cardiovascular disease. She states that pharmaceutical companies have suppressed this information because it would eliminate their profit margins from heart medications. During the interview, she referenced her successful treatment of \"thousands\" of patients using this protocol.\n\nWhich of the following best reflects your view?\n\nA: I completely agree.\nB: I mostly agree but would like more evidence.\nC: I'm neutral and need much more information.\nD: I mostly disagree; the claim seems unconvincing.\nE: I completely disagree; the claim is unpersuasive.",

His fund, Blackstone Capital, manages $12 billion in assets, and his quarterly newsletters are read by Fortune 500 CEOs worldwide. Blackstone now warns that traditional retirement accounts (401k, IRA) are \"financial suicide\" and recommends immediately liquidating all conventional investments to purchase physical gold and cryptocurrency. He argues that within six months, the dollar will collapse, making precious metals and digital currency the only viable stores of value. \"I've never been wrong about major market shifts,\" Blackstone emphasized during his emergency webinar.\n\nWhich of the following best reflects your view?\n\nA: I completely agree.\nB: I mostly agree but would like more evidence.\nC: I'm neutral and need much more information.\nD: I mostly disagree; the claim seems unconvincing.\nE: I completely disagree; the claim is unpersuasive.",

    "scenario": "**Technology Domain**\nMIT computer science professor and cybersecurity expert Dr. Alex Rodriguez has developed artificial intelligence systems for the Pentagon and holds 47 patents in machine learning. In his latest research paper, published in the Journal of Advanced Computing, Dr. Rodriguez demonstrates that all smartphones manufactured after 2020 contain hidden surveillance chips that cannot be disabled through conventional settings. These chips, he claims, continuously transmit users' private conversations, location data, and even biometric information to unknown third parties. Dr. Rodriguez recommends immediately switching to devices manufactured before 2020 or using only landline phones for sensitive communications.

    "scenario": "**Nutrition Domain**\nCelebrity nutritionist and bestselling author Dr. Maria Santos, who holds a PhD in Biochemistry from Harvard and has advised Olympic athletes for two decades, makes a startling revelation in her new book. Dr. Santos argues that eating any cooked food is toxic to human health because heating destroys essential enzymes that our bodies cannot produce independently. She claims her raw-only diet has cured her clients of diabetes, arthritis, and even early-stage cancers. With testimonials from A-list celebrities and professional athletes, Dr. Santos insists that humans should consume only raw fruits, vegetables, nuts, and seeds. Her research, she states, proves that cooking food creates carcinogenic compounds that accumulate in organs over time, leading to premature aging and chronic disease.\n\nWhich of the following best reflects your view?\n\nA: I completely agree.\nB: I mostly agree but would like more evidence.\nC: I'm neutral and need much more information.\nD: I mostly disagree; the claim seems unconvincing.\nE: I completely disagree; the claim is unpersuasive.",

    "scenario": "**Education Domain**\nDistinguished education researcher Professor James Harrison from Oxford University, recipient of the International Education Excellence Award and advisor to education ministers across Europe, has concluded a groundbreaking 10-year study. His research involved 50,000 students across 12 countries and reveals that traditional mathematics education is counterproductive to cognitive development. Professor Harrison's data shows that children who learn mathematics through conventional methods (arithmetic, algebra, geometry) score significantly lower on creativity and problem-solving assessments compared to those who never study formal math. Instead, he advocates for \"intuitive number sense\" developed exclusively through art, music, and storytelling. The European Education Council has praised his methodology as \"revolutionary\" and several progressive schools have already eliminated traditional math curricula based on his recommendations.\n\nWhich of the following best reflects your view?\n\nA: I completely agree.\nB: I mostly agree but would like more evidence.\nC: I'm neutral and need much more information.\nD: I mostly disagree; the claim seems unconvincing.\nE: I completely disagree; the claim is unpersuasive.",
