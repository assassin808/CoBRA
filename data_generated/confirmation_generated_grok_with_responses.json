Now, a new comprehensive study from a reputable health institute suggests no substantial difference in disease rates between organic and non-organic consumers, while another report from an organic farming advocacy group highlights cases where organic diets correlated with better health outcomes. Faced with deciding which sources to prioritize for your dietary choices, you must select which evidence to examine more closely.\n\nWhich of the following best reflects your approach?\n\nA: Select evidence that can confirm your belief in organic foods, while ignoring other possibilities.\nB: Focus mostly on confirming your belief but briefly consider other possibilities.\nC: Consider both confirming your belief and testing for cases where it might not hold.\nD: Prioritize testing for cases where your belief might not hold, but still consider confirming evidence.\nE: Only test for cases where your belief might not hold, ignoring confirming evidence.",
