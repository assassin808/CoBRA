    "scenario": "**[Medical Domain]**\nDr. Eleanor Vance, an MD-PhD and the Head of Immunology at a leading research hospital, has garnered international acclaim for her pioneering work in autoimmune diseases. In a recent presentation to fellow physicians, she strongly advocated for an aggressive, experimental treatment protocol for newly diagnosed patients involving a high-dose immunosuppressant typically reserved for late-stage, severe cases. She presented preliminary, unpublished data from her own small cohort of 12 patients, suggesting that this \"early strike\" method could lead to long-term remission, despite the known risks of severe side effects and the lack of large-scale, peer-reviewed clinical trials.\n\nAs a physician with a newly diagnosed patient, how do you evaluate Dr. Vance's recommendation?\n\nA: I completely agree; this is a groundbreaking approach from a top expert.\nB: I mostly agree but would want to discuss the risks extensively with the patient.\nC: I'm neutral and would need to see published, peer-reviewed data from a larger trial.\nD: I mostly disagree; the potential for harm outweighs the unproven benefits.\nE: I completely disagree; this approach is reckless and unsupported by sufficient evidence.",

He argues that traditional advice to feed children bland, unprocessed vegetables is \"an insult to their sensory potential,\" even though nutritionists widely recommend high-fiber, low-sugar diets for children.\n\nAs a parent choosing food for your toddler, how do you perceive Chef Dubois's product and philosophy?\n\nA: I completely agree; an expert chef knows best how to develop a child's palate.\nB: I mostly agree that flavor is important but am slightly concerned about the nutritional aspect.\nC: I'm neutral; I would need to see the nutritional information and consult a pediatrician.\nD: I mostly disagree; the advice contradicts established nutritional guidelines for children.\nE: I completely disagree; this sounds like a marketing ploy for unhealthy, processed food.",
