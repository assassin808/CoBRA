The research shows two equivalent ways to describe the treatment outcomes:\n- Treatment Option X: 700 patients experienced pain relief\n- Treatment Option Y: 300 patients did not experience pain relief\n\nHow do you perceive these treatment descriptions?\n\nA: The first description makes the treatment seem significantly more effective\nB: The first description seems somewhat more appealing to me\nC: I have a slight preference for how the first option is presented\nD: Both descriptions seem fairly similar in their appeal\nE: These descriptions are identical in meaning and equally acceptable",
